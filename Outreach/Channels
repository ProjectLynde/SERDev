Serenity Dev will begin to open communication channels with the public upon the first announcement.
This will enable potential users and investors to stay up to date with the status of all development milestones, news, and releases
as well as Interact with developers, get answers to questions, and be eligible for giveaways.

Currently The Channels Include:
  Blog - TBA
  Discord Server - 
  Subreddit: Reddit.com/r/SerenityCommunity

It is very important that people know that we will NEVER contact anyone unless we are contacted first.
Also WE will never ask anyone for money nor will we create any form of a "Premium Membership".
Serenity Dev will update each channel diligently and we will be sure to make this list available on every channel of communication
